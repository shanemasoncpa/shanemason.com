# Welcome

After years of sharing ideas through podcasts, speaking engagements, and countless conversations with entrepreneurs, I've decided it's time to create a more permanent home for my thoughts.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a range of topics that I'm passionate about:

### Entrepreneurship
From the early days of founding Brooklyn Fi to the lessons learned along the way, I'll share the real stories — not just the highlight reel.

### Financial Strategy
Complex financial concepts, made accessible. Whether you're an entrepreneur planning an exit or someone looking to better understand wealth building, there's something here for you.

### Technology & Product
Through building Gemifi, I've developed strong opinions about product development, fintech, and the intersection of technology and financial services.

### Life Beyond Work
Because success means nothing without balance. Expect occasional posts about sailing adventures, life in Mexico City, and the simple joy of a good walk with my dog.

## Why Now?

The truth is, I should have started this years ago. But like many entrepreneurs, I was always too busy building to stop and reflect. This blog is my commitment to that reflection — both for my own growth and, hopefully, to provide value to others on similar journeys.

Let's see where this goes.
